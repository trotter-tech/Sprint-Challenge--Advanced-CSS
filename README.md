1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
An adaptive website adapts to different screen sizes, while responsive uses media queries that are tailor made for the specific screen sizes.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Mobile first means you build the site for mobile devices and then use media queries to scale up.
Desktop first means you build for desktop screen sizes and use media queries to scale down.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
It alows us to conveniently scale font, and it also adjusts to the users font settings in their browser.


4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
preprocessing is different languages and syntax that give us more options than vanilla css. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
My favorite concept is nesting, the concept that gives me the most trouble is using mixins because I'm not used to them yet
